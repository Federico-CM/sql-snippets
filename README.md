# SQL snippets

**SQL snippets** is a curated collection of small, self-contained, and well-documented SQL examples designed to simplify common data tasks. Each snippet focuses on a specific concept—such as querying patterns, data transformations, window functions, or performance considerations—while remaining lightweight, readable, and easy to adapt across SQL dialects.

The repository is intended both as a practical reference and as a skills-maintenance toolkit for anyone working with data.

## Examples

Each directory contains focused SQL examples that demonstrate a particular technique or pattern.  
The questions answered by each example are listed in the file **`excercise_questions.csv`**.

These questions are meant to:
- Help you **practice SQL skills regularly so they don’t rust**
- Serve as **preparation material for job interviews**
- Provide **ready-to-use interview questions** for recruiters and hiring managers

You can attempt to solve the questions first, then compare your approach with the provided snippets.
